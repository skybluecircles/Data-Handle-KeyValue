=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Data::Handle::KeyValue::CSV;

  my $path_to_csv = '/path/to/foo.csv';
  my $csv_params  = { ... };

  my $header      = 1;
  my $data_handle = Data::Handle::KeyValue::CSV->new(
      path_to_csv => $path_to_csv,
      csv_params  => $csv_params,
      header      => $header,
  );

  my $column_names = [ ... ];
  my $data_handle  = Data::Handle::KeyValue::CSV->new(
      path_to_csv  => $path_to_csv,
      csv_params   => $csv_params,
      column_names => $column_names,
  );

  while ( my $row = $data_handle->next_row() ) {
      ...
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The modules in L<Data::Handle::KeyValue> provide a consistent interface for fetching rows of hash refs. In particular Data::Handle::KeyValue::CSV does so for a CSV file.

=head1 CONSTRUCTION

=head2 C<new>

Takes one required parameter: C<path_to_csv> which, as you can see, is the path to the csv file you would like to read.

Also requires one of the following two parameters: C<header> or C<column_names>. If Perl evaluates C<header> to be true, this module uses the first line of the file to get the keys for the columns. If C<header> is false, this module expects you to pass the column names explicitly as an array ref for the C<column_names> attribute.

Optionally, you may pass a hash ref for C<csv_params>. This module uses L<Text::CSV> to read the csv file, so C<csv_params> is passed directly to Text::CSV. If C<csv_params> is not passed, the defaults for Text::CSV are used.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<next_row>

Fetches the next row of your csv file and returns it as a hash ref.
